# Spring Boot Bootcamp

This repository contains my work during "The Complete Spring Boot Development Bootcamp." The bootcamp is designed to help you become a proficient Java Web Developer and build powerful APIs using the Spring Boot framework.

## Description

Spring Boot is a leading Java framework for developing web applications. It emphasizes convention over configuration, making it incredibly easy to create stand-alone, production-grade web services and APIs.

## Curriculum

1. **Model View Controller (MVC)**
   Build a web application adhering to the Model View Controller design pattern for a well-organized and maintainable codebase.

2. **Field Validation**
   Implement field validation to ensure data integrity and prevent the storage of invalid data.

3. **Three-Layer Codebase**
   Refactor your code into a three-layer architecture to ensure cleanliness and scalability.

4. **Bean and Dependency Injection**
   Loosely couple your code using beans and dependency injection for improved modularity.

5. **Testing a Spring Boot Web Application**
   Write unit and integration tests to verify that your application behaves correctly and is free from defects.

6. **React Integration**
   Connect your Spring Boot application to a React front-end for a seamless user experience.

7. **REST API Development**
   Develop a REST API capable of processing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.

8. **OpenAPI Documentation**
   Document your application using the OpenAPI specification to ensure clear communication and understanding of your API.

9. **Exception Handling**
   Make your API resilient by implementing exception handling inside `@ControllerAdvice` to gracefully handle unexpected situations.

10. **Spring Data JPA (SQL)**
    Develop a REST API that interacts with an SQL database using Spring Data JPA. Define relational tables with `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` relationships.

11. **Spring Boot Security**
    Secure your application through both Basic and Token-based Authentication (JWT) to protect sensitive data and ensure a secure user experience.
